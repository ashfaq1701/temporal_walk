A modified implementation of temporal walk algorithm from "Continuous-Time Dynamic Network Embeddings" paper. Developed by [Packets Research Lab](https://packets-lab.github.io/).

## Introduction

This project enables the construction of large temporal networks in memory, from which temporal walks can be sampled. Temporal walks are invaluable in graph neural networks (GNNs) for learning network dynamics.

This library facilitates the creation of temporal graphs and the incremental sampling of temporal walks based on the current graph state, making it especially useful for training GNNs. PyBind is interfaced which let's the functions to be called from Python. For convenience the walks are returned as numpy arrays.

The library also supports the creation of continuous graphs with a maximum time capacity, where edges with timestamps older than the current time minus the maximum capacity are automatically deleted.

## Definitions

A temporal network represents a dynamic system where edges or interactions between nodes vary over time. In contrast to static networks, temporal networks capture changes and sequences in connectivity, which is essential in understanding real-world phenomena like social interactions, information spread, and transportation flows over time.

A temporal walk is a path through a temporal network that respects the order of timestamps on edges, ensuring causality. Temporal walks are particularly useful for applications in graph neural networks (GNNs), where learning temporal dependencies enhances the model's ability to predict or understand evolving network structures.

### Example

For a given temporal network with following edges (upstream node, downstream node, timestamp),

```pytchon
[
    (4, 5, 71),
    (3, 5, 82),
    (1, 3, 19),
    (4, 2, 34),
    (4, 3, 79),
    (2, 5, 19),

## Installation

This project can be installed using pip.

```bash
pip install temporal-walk
```

## Functions

`TemporalWalk` class contains the public facing functions.

### Constructor

```cpp
TemporalWalk(bool is_directed, int64_t max_time_capacity=-1, bool enable_weight_computation=false, double timescale_bound=50.0);
```

Initializes a (Un)directed TemporalWalk object with the maximum time capacity of the graph. The is_directed parameter defines if the graph is directed or not. The default value of `max_time_capacity` is -1, which means unlimited capacity. If set then edges older than `max_time_capacity` from the latest timestamp are deleted automatically. `enable_weight_computation` defines if CTDNE weights will be computed or not. It must be true to use `ExponentialWeight` random picker. Default is false, which will only enable the index based random pickers. For very large time differences `timescale_bound` is used to scale the time differences between 0 and the given value.

### add_multiple_edges

```cpp
void add_multiple_edges(const std::vector<std::tuple<int, int, int64_t>>& edge_infos);
```

Adds multiple edges to the temporal graph based on the provided vector of tuple structures, where each tuple contains the source node, destination node, and timestamp.

### get_random_walks_for_all_nodes

```cpp
